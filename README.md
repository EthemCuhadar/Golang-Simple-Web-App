## Very simple web application

This is a very simple web application. There is just a handler function in implementation.

* Usage is very simple. Run the go file via terminal (This will connect the local host.)

```[terminal]
go run first_webapp.go
```

* After that, go **http://localhost:8080** in a web browser and enter.

Voila! First web application is ready. Let's you give the address as **http://localhost:8080/Golang/Is/The/Best** , you will see the response on the screen!
